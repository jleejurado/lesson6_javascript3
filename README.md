### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned the definition and uses of a BOM (Browser Object Model). The BOM contains a Document object in which the changes implemented to a dynamic web page. Because of the frequent fluctiations, the Document Object has its own Document Object Model (DOM). 
2. I learned that the document.addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the document. By doing research on w3school.com, I also learned that the addEventListener() method is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions. This is yet another reason why Chrome is a great browser.
3. I learned that an HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree. This allows the programmer to easily follow along with and later track the actions implemented on a dynamic web page.
